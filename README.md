# ZOMATO-RESTAURANTS-RATING-PREDICTION
Zomato is one of the best online food delivery apps which gives the users the ratings and
the reviews on restaurants all over India. These ratings and the Reviews are considered as one of
the most important deciding factors which determine how good a restaurant is. We will therefore
use the real time Data set with various features a user would look into regarding a restaurant. We
will be considering Bangalore City in this analysis. Content The basic idea of analysing the
Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types
of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru
being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all
over the world.
Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the
restaurant food as they don’t have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming
demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location.
What kind of a food is more popular in a locality. These kind of analysis can be done using the
data, by studying the factors such as
• Location of the restaurant
• Approx Price of food
• Theme based restaurant or not
• Which locality of that city serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants
• The needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the neighbourhood
• Is a particular neighbourhood famous for its own kind of food.
“Just so that you have a good meal the next time you step out” 1 The data is accurate to that
available on the Zomato website until 15 March 2019. The data was scraped from Zomato in two
phase. After going through the structure of the website I found that for each neighbourhood there
are 6-7 category of restaurants viz. Buffet, Cafes, Delivery, Desserts, Dine-out, Drinks & nightlife,
Pubs and bars.
